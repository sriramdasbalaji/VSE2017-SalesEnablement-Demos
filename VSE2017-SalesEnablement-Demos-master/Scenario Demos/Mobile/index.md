# Mobile Development Scenarios

Mobile devices are now at the center of the technology ecosystem. Users cannot live without their mobile devices and organize their lives and information with them. Employees bring them to the workplace and depend on them to get things done. In fact, the mobile revolution is not “coming” or “under way”, it has already happened! And the mobile tidal wave proved to be faster and bigger than anything that came before it. We call this the appification of modern business – the proliferation of targeted, highly optimized apps designed for a particular group of users or specific task or purpose. But what does an appified business look like - and how can this state be achieved in a quick and efficient manner? Especially if your core competency is not software development, this can seem daunting. In fact, this is one of the most common challenges enterprises are facing - how to deliver apps at scale.

How is it that some companies like Netflix, Amazon, Etsy, and Facebook regularly deliver new features and innovation to their customers while other companies must wait weeks or months to release software updates? Today, we see continual frustration in all phases of the software development lifecycle:
- Business, customers and IT all suffer from a lack of collaboration and communication between development and operations in software projects. This increases time and labor involved in delivering and maintaining software – not a good thing in a world where fast time to market is key.
- Add to that the problem that much of what we build is based on assumptions instead of hard data and you can see how this could easily lead a team to build the wrong thing. The inability to deliver software efficiently and react quickly to changes can lead to much more than just frustration – in the long run, this can threaten an entire business!

DevOps is not new – and it promises to solve these problems. What we see - especially in larger organizations – are two distinct lifecycles existing side-by-side: development and IT operations, with clear demarcations and barriers between them. For Microsoft - the world’s largest software company - DevOps has always been about unifying those two worlds. A converged DevOps lifecycle gives you the ability to execute on ideas quickly, iterate on feedback rapidly, with minimum friction while at the same time maintaining the highest levels of quality.

## <a name="beginners"></a> Beginners to Mobile Development

**Scenario description:**  
This scenario includes all customers/prospects who are new to mobile development (beginners). They have no active mobile apps and they don't have a mobile strategy that is current. They understand that they need mobile to succeed but have minimal understanding of how they can achieve mobile success.

## <a name="crossplatform"></a>Platform-specific to Cross-platform Mobile Development
**Scenario description:**  
This scenario includes all customers/prospects who have existing platform-specific (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) mobile apps and are looking to move these apps to a cross-platform platform environment for higher efficiency, cost reduction, and lower maintenance. They understand the importance of mobile and know that mobile is critical to their success going forward. They have reasonable understanding of how mobile can help them succeed but are now looking to further optimize that (wanting to reduce their costs, leverage existing resources, etc.) as they expand their mobile efforts.

## <a name="quality"></a>Shipping high-quality apps
**Scenario description:**   
Whether customers are a mobile-focused startup or a multi-million- dollar enterprise, app quality is critical. Users are less forgiving of performance issues, such as slow load times and crashes, for mobile apps than they are for web apps. They are more prone to deleting apps and leaving negative reviews and ratings which can significantly impact businesses. Shipping high-quality apps is critical to success

##  <a name="mobiledevops"></a>End-to-end Mobile Development with Mobile DevOps
**Scenario description:**   
Mobile is more than just building the app. It includes testing, monitoring, iterating, and continuously maintaining the app. Mobile DevOps solves unique challenges at every stage of the mobile lifecycle. It simplifies mobile development by automating the entire release pipeline, from planning to Continuous Improvement, and accelerating release cycles, delivering high quality apps, and allowing customers to spend more time on new features.

## <a name="intelligentapp"></a>Building Smart Apps that users love to use
**Scenario description:**   
Smart mobile apps focus on providing the best user experiences by taking the user’s contextual information and tailoring their experiences based on that. Smart apps use data and historical information for predictive analytics anticipating user actions and accordingly providing the right information at the right time and place. Smart apps will keep users engaged and continuously connected to their apps.
