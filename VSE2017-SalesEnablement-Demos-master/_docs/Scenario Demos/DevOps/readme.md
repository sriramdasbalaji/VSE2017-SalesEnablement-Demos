DevOps Scenarios

<p align="center"><img src="images/devops.jpg" align="center"></p>

An organization’s custom software is its primary competitive differentiator and critical to providing rich experiences powered by critical, time-sensitive data to its customers and business users. In this fast-paced word of Cloud First, Mobile First, rapidly delivering quality software is no longer an option, it’s a requirement. Gone are the days of lengthy planning sessions and development iterations.  Cloud platforms such as Microsoft VSTS and Azure have removed traditional bottlenecks and helped commoditize infrastructure. Software reigns in every business as the key differentiator and factor in business outcomes. No organization, developer or IT worker can or should avoid the DevOps movement.

**DevOps** is defined from numerous points of view, but most often refers to removing both cultural and technology barriers between development and operations teams so software can move into production as efficiently as possible. Once software is running in production you need to ensure you can capture rich usage data and feed that data back into development teams and decision makers.

## <a name="gettingstarted"></a>Getting Started with DevOps
**Scenario Description**:   
DevOps helps teams drive toward continuous delivery and leverage data from running applications to help make better-informed decisions. 
Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services provides everything a team needs in a single solution including agile planning, source code control, package management, build, testing and release automation to continuously integrate, test, deliver and monitor application. It is a complete DevOps toolchain to help  deploy your application faster with confidence.

##  <a name="mobiledevops"></a>End-to-end Mobile Development with Mobile DevOps
**Scenario description:**   
Mobile is more than just building the app. It includes testing, monitoring, iterating, and continuously maintaining the app. Mobile DevOps solves unique challenges at every stage of the mobile lifecycle. It simplifies mobile development by automating the entire release pipeline, from planning to Continuous Improvement, and accelerating release cycles, delivering high quality apps, and allowing customers to spend more time on new features.

##  <a name="javadevops"></a>Java DevOps with VSTS and TFS   

**Scenario description:**   
In this session, we will present many of the features available in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to support end-to-ebd DevOps specifically to build and deploy a Java application running in the cloud.  We will utilize the Kanban board planning feature to select a task; use a Git workflow to make a change via a Pull Request (PR); utilize a PR build for a Maven project including running Junit tests, JaCoCo code coverage, and SonarQube analysis; utilize CI/CD to build and deploy the project POM file via a Linux agent to a Tomcat server running in Azure.  Traceability will be shown from the task through to the deployment.   Other cross-platform capabilities will be presented including the ability to interface with Jenkins and deploy using UrbanCode Deploy, JBoss/Wildfly and Websphere.
**Demo Assets:**
- Java Capabilities and Feature [Briefing](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/java/alm/Shared%20Documents/MS%20Presentations/Java_Jax_April.20.2016.pptx)

##  <a name="databasedevops"></a>Extending DevOps Practices to SQL Server Databases
**Scenario description:**   
Without the right processes in place, database change management slows things down, adding risk and uncertainty and getting in the way of development and operations working together to add value.

Redgate helps you remove the bottleneck by giving you a reliable, scalable and repeatable process for building, deploying and maintaining SQL Server databases, in the same way you do for your application code.
