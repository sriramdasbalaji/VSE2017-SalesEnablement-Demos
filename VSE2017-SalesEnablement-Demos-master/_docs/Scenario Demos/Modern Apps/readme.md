#Modern Apps Scenarios

<p align="center"><img src="images/code.jpg" align="center"></p>

Modern apps adapt to the needs of users by providing personalized experiences and natural user
interactions, exchanging data with other apps as needed, and by providing social connections—all from
an array of device types supported by cloud services. 

These capabilities allow organizations that use modern apps to pursue the following business
opportunities:
- Capture new customers or retain existing customers by providing engaging experiences on an array of
devices to drive customer loyalty and to generate revenue growth.
- Expand their offerings to the global marketplace of existing products and services to strengthen
competitive advantage.
- Respond more quickly to market demand by increasing business agility and obtaining more customer
insights.
